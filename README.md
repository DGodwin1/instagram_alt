# instagram_alt
- I wanted to find out a way to get alt-text data from Instagram posts. 🤔
- Didn't look like I could get that from Instagram API. 🙄
- So I did this little thing instead. 🐎
- Would be interested in developing a frontend so I can display the image and what Instagram 'thinks' is there. 📸
